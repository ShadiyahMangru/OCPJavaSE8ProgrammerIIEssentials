## Lambda Built-in Functional Interfaces
 - A functional interface has exactly one abstract method.
 - Java does NOT include built-in support for primitive functional interfaces that include float, char, or short; there is nothing, however, to prevent a developer from creating them in their own project.
 - The java.util.function package does NOT include any functional interfaces that operate on the primitive float.
- Java only includes primitive functional interfaces that operate on double, int, or long.
 - A Function needs to specify TWO generics -- the input parameter type and the return value type.
 - It IS possible to have a functional interface that takes no values and returns void (e.g., Runnable).
 - BiPredicate takes two generic types and returns a **primitive** boolean value (NOT a Boolean object).
 - Important to know number of parameters, types, return value, and method name for each of the functional interfaces.
